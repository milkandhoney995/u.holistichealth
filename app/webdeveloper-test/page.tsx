      Hi! I'm <strong>Utano Harada</strong>, a Web Front-end Engineer.
      Making the most of components in Vue/React.js and Sass styles, I would change the tedious scripts more easy to read, and give them higher maintainability.
      <br />
      <br />
      I have worked on several open source apps, and been in charge of <strong>ensuring reusablility and componentizing React/Vue apps.</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm passionate about simplifying and optimizing the intricate and lengthy script. In previous project, I have both experience of implementing/refactoring existing app and of launching new app. I'm highly motivated to every single project!
      <br />
      <strong>I'm currently looking for the Web/Mobiledevelopment.</strong>
